# Laptop-price-prediction
 This analysis will help in understanding various characteristics of laptops, such as price distribution, the relationship between screen size and price, average prices by manufacturer, and more.  The project aims to provide insights into the laptop market, which can be useful for consumers, manufacturers, and retailers.

Objective:

The primary objective of this project is to preprocess and visualize a dataset of laptops. This analysis will help in understanding various characteristics of laptops, such as price distribution, the relationship between screen size and price, average prices by manufacturer, and more.

The project aims to provide insights into the laptop market, which can be useful for consumers, manufacturers, and retailers.

Dataset Description:

The dataset contains information about various laptops, including their manufacturers, specifications, and prices.

The columns in the dataset are as follows:

1. Unnamed: 0: Index column (to be dropped)
2. Company: Manufacturer of the laptop
3. TypeName: Type of laptop (e.g., Ultrabook, Notebook)
4. Inches: Screen size in inches
5. ScreenResolution: Screen resolution details
6. Cpu: CPU specifications
7. Ram: Amount of RAM
8. Memory: Storage details
9. Gpu: GPU specifications
10. OpSys: Operating system
11. Weight: Weight of the laptop
12. Price: Price of the laptop

Steps Involved:
Data Preprocessing:

1. Remove the redundant index column.
2. Handle missing values.
3. Convert data types as necessary (e.g., Price and Weight to numeric values).
4. Extract useful information from columns like ScreenResolution, Cpu, and Memory.

Data Visualization:

Tools and Libraries:
1. Pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
2. Matplotlib and Seaborn: For data visualization.
